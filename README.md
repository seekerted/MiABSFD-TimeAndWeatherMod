# MiABSFD Time and Weather Mod

## Current Features

- **Day/Night cycle**. Time moves in the surface and in the Abyss. Time dilation is accounted for as well (time moves faster depending on how deep you are and where you're travelling to). The time dilation is felt when ascending.

## Todo Features

- [ ] **Weather**
- [ ] More time-based events, like surface people being asleep / present or not

### Maybe Features

- [ ] Add features in-game that take into account time, like sleeping to pass time in the Abyss.
