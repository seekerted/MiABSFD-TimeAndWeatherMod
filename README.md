# MiABSFD Time and Weather Mod

## Features

- **Time (Day/Night cycle)**. The in-game environment and background pictures change depending on the time. Time moves at a rate of 1 IRL second = 1 in-game minute. Time dilation is accounted for as well (time moves faster depending on how deep you are and where you're travelling to). It is felt when ascending.
- **Weather**. Every so often the weather will turn bad and may cause rain, snow, etc. The chances of bad weather increases the higher whistle rank you are.

Please note that time and weather are only added in as cosmetics. They do not affect anything gameplay wise besides making the game look cooler. Well, besides maybe traversing during the nighttime and/or harsh weather, which can be quite a challenge. I recommend getting helmets with a flashlight on them!

> [!WARNING]
> This mod is experimental and might cause your game to crash during gameplay. Please stock up on Mail Balloons and save regularly.

## Maybe Ideas
_Things that I might do in the future if I ever plan on getting to them_

- [ ] Add features in-game that take into account time, like sleeping to pass time in the Abyss.
- [ ] More time-based events, like surface people being asleep / present or not
- [ ] Further refine the time and weather cosmetics
